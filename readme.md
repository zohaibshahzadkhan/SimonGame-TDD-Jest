# Simon Game

Welcome to the Simon Game, a classic memory game where you test your memory skills by repeating increasingly longer sequences of lights and sounds.

## About

The Simon Game project is a web-based implementation of the classic Simon game. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and follows the traditional rules of the Simon game:

- The game starts with a sequence of colors that the player must remember.
- The player then repeats the sequence by clicking on the colored buttons in the correct order.
- If the player succeeds, the game adds another color to the sequence, making it longer and more challenging.
- If the player makes a mistake, the game ends.

## Features

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: The game logic was developed using a Test-Driven Development approach, ensuring robustness and reliability. All code changes were driven by tests, guaranteeing that each feature behaves as expected.
- **Jest Testing**: The project uses Jest, a JavaScript testing framework, for unit and integration testing the game logic. Jest ensures that each component and function of the game operates correctly and reliably.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is designed to be responsive, providing an optimal experience across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is designed to be responsive, providing an optimal experience across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Scoring System**: The game keeps track of the player's score, rewarding successful sequences and challenging them to achieve higher scores.
- **New Game Button**: Players can start a new game at any time by clicking the "New Game" button.
